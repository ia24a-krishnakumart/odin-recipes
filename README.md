This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project is to create a simple recipe website using basic HTML skills.

 

## Project Description

 

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. Each recipe will have its own page with a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions.

 

## Skills Demonstrated

 

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

- Basic HTML structure

- Creating links between different HTML pages

- Using lists to organize content

- Structuring a simple website

 

This project serves as a foundation for more complex web development projects in the future.
